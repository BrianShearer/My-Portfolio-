# My-Portfolio-

this is week two challenge for Boot-camp. In this repository I worked on a webpage as a resume show casing my abilities with coding. This is my first try at coding from scratch using only html and CSS. 

I used two other repositories as as examples trying their code and then looking up google sources to see if it was best fit for my intended purpose. If you check the Style.css file will see many redacted etries. 
I still have a ways to go and intend to spend more time working with CSS to understand flex. I was able to use devtools also in learning. I am looking forward to improving this site.
